# EduSphere Authentication System Update

## Overview
The authentication system has been completely revamped to use a teacher-student hierarchy model with PIN-based authentication instead of email/password registration.

## New Authentication Flow

### 1. Teacher Login
- Teachers are pre-seeded in the database with name and 5-digit PIN
- Teachers login using their full name + PIN
- No self-registration - teachers are added to the system by administrators

### 2. Student Creation & Login
- Teachers create students from their dashboard
- Teachers assign a name and 5-digit PIN to each student
- Students login using the credentials provided by their teacher
- Students are automatically associated with their teacher

## Database Changes

### Updated User Model
```typescript
interface IUser {
  name: string              // Full name instead of email
  pin: string              // 5-digit PIN instead of password
  role: 'teacher' | 'student'
  teacherId?: ObjectId     // For students - reference to their teacher
  students?: ObjectId[]    // For teachers - array of their students
  courses: ObjectId[]
  avatar?: string
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Key Features
- **Unique constraint**: Each name+PIN combination must be unique
- **Teacher-Student relationship**: Students are linked to their creating teacher
- **No email required**: Simplified authentication using names and PINs

## Pre-seeded Teachers

The following teachers are available for testing:

| Name | PIN |
|------|-----|
| John Smith | 12345 |
| Sarah Johnson | 23456 |
| Michael Brown | 34567 |
| Emily Davis | 45678 |
| David Wilson | 56789 |

## Updated Components

### 1. Login Page (`/auth/login`)
- Updated to use name + PIN fields
- PIN validation (exactly 5 digits)
- Removed registration link

### 2. Teacher Dashboard
- Added **Student Management** section
- Teachers can create new students
- View all created students
- Copy student credentials
- Show/hide PINs for security

### 3. API Endpoints

## Benefits of New System

1. **Simplified Setup**: No complex registration flows
2. **Teacher Control**: Teachers manage their own students
3. **Easy Distribution**: Simple name+PIN credentials
4. **Classroom Management**: Clear teacher-student relationships
5. **Security**: PIN-based authentication suitable for educational environments
6. **No Email Dependencies**: Works without email infrastructure

## Next Steps

1. Test the authentication flow with the seeded teachers
2. Create sample students using the teacher dashboard
3. Test student login functionality
4. Verify teacher-student relationships work correctly
5. Add course management integration with the new user model
